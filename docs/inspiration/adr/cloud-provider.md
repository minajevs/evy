# Choosing cloud provider

### Render.com

**Hard No**

Banned my account for no reason, then didn't answer mails for 28 days, until I explicitly pinged them. Took them 2 more days to unlock account.

### Railway.app

**No**

Worked fine, actually. DX is good. Cost ~7$ per month for nextjs+postgres instances.

Does not provide EU region (at least for cheap)

### Fly.io

**No**

Looks like a fine solution, however does not provide managed DB.

### PlanetScale

Just for managed DB, actually

**No**

Works fine, but is more complex to handle (migrations?, mysql, branches). External DB does not sound good performance-wise. Latency in the same region is around ~200ms (GCP/AWS different?)

### Northflank

**To try**

Pricing is weird to predict.
