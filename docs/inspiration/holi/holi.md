Looks like a great inspiration place for flows. It is possible to create "spaces", groups, etc., which closely resemble collections.

## "Spaces"

closely resemble collections

## Create "Space"

"Wizard" creation. See "create" pngs

## "Spaces" menu in navigation

2 tabs: "Mine" and "Discover"

Makes sense to have "My collections" and "Discover" options in navigation.

## General flow

After "Space" is created it is displayed for the owner in the "end state", the same how other users see it.

Editing is a separate page.

Child items on the "SPace", such as "Tasks", "What's new", etc. are added within normal UI. See "space-view.png".
When "plus button" is pressed, new page to create stuff opens.
When stuff is created, user is redirected back to "normal UI".

Editing/deleting stuff is a "3-dot" button menu on a "stuff" card on the normal ui
