1. Focus on advantages and benefits of your product straight on.

2. Do show your product. It’s hard and difficult to keep it up to date, but the value outweighs the cost.

3. Use short memorable phrasing, but expand as necessary.

4. If your product has nerd value baked into it (e.g. some powerful protocol that mainstream competitors do not implement) do make it a major feature but explain the benefits to the uninitiated (“we support JMAP, the more powerful alternative to IMAP that allows you to use X app and service”)

5. On the visual side: keep it simple and add a single gimmick, such a background pattern or a strange gradient. Reuse that same gimmick in subtler versions with color/shape/position variations. Always strive for readability, not effect.

6. Pricing must be easily accessible. Explain in simple words if exceptions apply (student discounts etc)
